For this project, we survey a number of approaches for click-through rate prediction.
Our goal is, for a given set of features, to predict whether or not an ad will be
clicked or not.

Before surveying different learning methods for the CTR prediction problem, we inspected the
datasets and converted them into the appropriate format.
\1.converting_data_matlab_code: matlab code to transfer the string data into numerical dataset

Then we tried naive bayes, decision tree, perceptron and FTRL-Proximal algorithm (a regularized logistic regression).
\2.Naive_Bayes: matlab code for naive bayes
\3.DecisionTree_code: python code for decision tree
\4.Perceptron: matlab code for online learning algorithm
\5.FTRL_parameter_tuning_and_prediction_code: matlab code for FTRL-Proximal algorithm, 
	including hyper-parameter tuning via cross-validation and the learning and predicting code on full dataset.
